    <h2>Proposition: Complaint Processing is Fair and Blind to Ethinicity of the Officers</h2>

      <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
      <ul class="infographic-points">
        <li>While rate would usually be the metric used in seeing how biased a system is, this rate may not actually be good in a wider context. This only focuses on the complaints given and how they are processed but does not give insight to the proportion of complaints to the total number of officers in each category. I rate the deception at -1 as the data itself does not give a clear view of exactly what is going on outside of just complaints alone.</li>
        <li>I made sure to clearly label the axis and make them as straight forward as possible. Since the main deception was in the data being graphed, I tried to use as simple of a chart as possible to provide an illusion of a visualization so simple that there cannot be any possible manipulation going on. I rate this as a 2 as this is just part of making a good visualization.</li>
        <li>Similarly, I used a double encoding of color and shape to make it obvious the lines as they are pretty close together at the end so changing the shapes will make each point stand out a little but more against each other. This was just trying to make the chart as clear as possible which i think would get a rating of 2 as it was not trying to decieve anyone.</li>

      <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
      <ul class="infographic-points">
        <li>Given how similar the formats of the 2 visualizations are, I wanted to emphsize that simple change in the calculated fields can achieve vastly different conclusions. here I used only the counts metric to obscure the underlying statistic that there are simply more complaints against white officers than black officers leading to the large discrepancy. I rate this as a -2 and very deceptive as it is missing vitally relevant data.</li>
        <li>One of the details I was struggling with was when to put as the year as we had 2 dates, a opening date and a closing date. Since I found the proposition to do more with the conclusion of teh report rather than who opened the report, I deciided to use the closing date to track closer with what the relevant date would be for the proposition. I rate this a 1 as there can be some ambiguiity on why closing data was chosen over the opening date bute It comes from a more thoughtful place than actual tricking.</li>
        <li>While I could have scaled the y-axis, I kept it in linear scale to keep an earnest looking scale and limit the potential red flags. I rate this as a 2 earnest. </li>

          Creating both visualizations provided a valuable opportunity to explore how data transformations and framing can powerfully influence interpretation. The most straightforward part of the design process was the technical implementation—constructing clear, visually clean line charts with proper labeling, consistent color schemes, and shape encoding for clarity. However, the conceptual work—deciding what to show, what to omit, and how to structure the narrative—proved much more nuanced. Choosing between absolute counts and proportional rates, and grappling with the implications of each, was particularly challenging. The exercise revealed how drastically a shift in metric can reshape a viewer’s understanding, even when the underlying dataset remains constant.

          What surprised me most was how subtle design decisions—like axis scaling, annotation tone, or even the title—can dramatically influence perceived neutrality or bias. Through this process, my understanding of “ethical analysis and visualization” has evolved. I now see it as the careful balance between truthful representation and rhetorical clarity. Ethical visualization involves being honest not only in the data shown but also in what’s left out and why. Acceptable persuasive choices are those rooted in transparency and context: you can emphasize a point, but you must also equip viewers with the tools to question and interpret it themselves. Misleading choices, by contrast, hide or obscure critical context—such as denominators in rates or dataset composition—in order to push a singular, often unjustified conclusion.

        <p>
          Ultimately, the line between persuasive and deceptive lies in intent and disclosure. Persuasion that encourages critical engagement is ethical; persuasion that inhibits it is not. This project reaffirmed the responsibility that comes with data storytelling: the visual choices we make aren’t neutral, and their implications can shape public perception in profound ways.
