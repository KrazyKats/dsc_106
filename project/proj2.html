      <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
      <ul class="infographic-points">
        <li>While rate would usually be the metric used in seeing how biased a system is, this rate may not actually be good in a wider context. This only focuses on the complaints given and how they are processed but does not give insight to the proportion of complaints to the total number of officers in each category. I rate the deception at -1 as the data itself does not give a clear view of exactly what is going on outside of just complaints alone.</li>
        <li>I made sure to clearly label the axis and make them as straight forward as possible. Since the main deception was in the data being graphed, I tried to use as simple of a chart as possible to provide an illusion of a visualization so simple that there cannot be any possible manipulation going on. I rate this as a 2 as this is just part of making a good visualization.</li>
        <li>Similarly, I used a double encoding of color and shape to make it obvious the lines as they are pretty close together at the end so changing the shapes will make each point stand out a little but more against each other. This was just trying to make the chart as clear as possible which i think would get a rating of 2 as it was not trying to decieve anyone.</li>

      <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
      <ul class="infographic-points">
        <li>Given how similar the formats of the 2 visualizations are, I wanted to emphsize that simple change in the calculated fields can achieve vastly different conclusions. here I used only the counts metric to obscure the underlying statistic that there are simply more complaints against white officers than black officers leading to the large discrepancy. I rate this as a -2 and very deceptive as it is missing vitally relevant data.</li>
        <li>One of the details I was struggling with was when to put as the year as we had 2 dates, a opening date and a closing date. Since I found the proposition to do more with the conclusion of teh report rather than who opened the report, I deciided to use the closing date to track closer with what the relevant date would be for the proposition. I rate this a 1 as there can be some ambiguiity on why closing data was chosen over the opening date bute It comes from a more thoughtful place than actual tricking.</li>
        <li>While I could have scaled the y-axis, I kept it in linear scale to keep an earnest looking scale and limit the potential red flags. I rate this as a 2 earnest. </li>

        Creating both visualizations provided a valuable opportunity to explore how data transformations and framing can powerfully influence interpretation. The most straightforward part of the design process was the technical implementation. I also really wanted to have the visualization to reflect each other in form. However, choosing how to decieve the reader was difficult to say since given I did the data analysis, everythiong I did seemed very obvious. Thus I really got help from others trying to see what worked and what did not.

        What surprised me most was how subtle design decisions, like axis scaling, can easily draw attention to wierd things especially if the 2 visualizations look similar in form. For example, I tried changing y-axis scale for visualization 2 for a bigger difference but I was easily seen by my test group.

        I think that ethical analysis and visualization is when a person clearly explores the data and attempts to understand the entirety of the set and use minimal distortions to visualize a conclusion. However, it is often in reporting that there willl be some sort of bias thus I would need to set bounds on what is too deceptive and misleading or what is unethical. To that end, we need to recognize that between peers, we ought to make available the data set and the underlying methods for scrutiny and analysis so others may critique the methods used. When presenting to the public, the narrative should be well defined and the methodology well documented. To distiguish between persuasive choices vs misleading choices, it is hard to say as the readers will generally be biased to say something is misleading if they hold prior thoughts against the idea and persuasive if the ideas allign with theirs. I think proper disclosure and meaningful transparency is the best we can get to show misleading argument and persuasive ones.
