    <h2>Proposition: Complaint Processing is Fair and Blind to Ethinicity of the Officers</h2>

      <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
      <ul class="infographic-points">
        <li>While rate would usually be the metric used in seeing how biased a system is, this rate may not actually be good in a wider context. This only focuses on the complaints given and how they are processed but does not give insight to the proportion of complaints to the total number of officers in each category. I rate the deception at -1 as the data itself does not give a clear view of exactly what is going on outside of just complaints alone.</li>
        <li>I made sure to clearly label the axis and make them as straight forward as possible. Since the main deception was in the data being graphed, I tried to use as simple of a chart as possible to provide an illusion of a visualization so simple that there cannot be any possible manipulation going on. I rate this as a 2 as this is just part of making a good visualization.</li>
